# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This dataset was grabbed from Kaggle and can be found at the following link:

Given my interest in wanting to detect fraud for a project at work, I figured that familiarizing myself with this particular project on Kaggle could give me a good head start.

This dataset contains credit card transactions made by European cardholders for two day in September 2013. There are 492 fraudulent transactions out of a total of 284,807 transactions. This impies that the data is highly unbalanced.

To address the imbalance ratio, it was recommended to measure the accuracy using the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC). Confusion matrix accuracy is not meaningful for unbalanced classification.
